# Dungeon Crawler Simulator
Week 2 of my IT-course focused on OOP Java, so I made this small Dungeon Crawler sim/game
(heavily inspired by [Dark and Darker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590)).

## The game
Progress through the dungeon by looting, equipping and slaying monsters!

## Missing features
The game is now runnable and somewhat playable, here is alist of missing features:
* [ ] Update win condition - currently none
* [x] Make Strength affect damage dealt by player
* [ ] Introduce Altars to post combat (give status effect for next combat encounter, Will cost)
* [ ] Introduce Dodge, Miss and Crit to combat encounter
* [ ] Add abilities
* [ ] Add perks
* [ ] Introduce status effects from abilities & perks to combat encounters
* [ ] Implement resting option "Pray" (to reset certain abilities and perks) 
* [ ] Add Artifacts (weapons with added status effects)
